Divs are basically ways to break up content on a website, separating them into little boxes. Ids let us know what the content is.
Alt text is used to explain in more detail what the media (video or image) is so screen readers can explain it to visually impaired people.
my work process was following along with the video like much of the previous weeks, as well as reading the website when i got confused on a step.
