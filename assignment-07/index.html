      <h1>Song Lyrics</h1>
      <pre>Gloria, I smell it on your breath
          Gloria, booze and peppermint
          Gloria, no one said enough is enough
          Gloria, they found you on the floor
          Gloria, my hand was tied to yours
          And, Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?
          Did you know me when I was younger then?
          I could take the whole world with me
          I would find myself feelin' alone
          Heaven, help me now, Heaven, show the way
          Get me back on my own two feet
          I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
          Oh-oh-oh-oh
          Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
          Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
          Gloria, you crawled up on your cross
          Gloria, you made us sit and watch
          Gloria, no one said enough is enough
          Heaven, help me now (hey, hey), Heaven, show the way (Heaven, show)
          Get me back on my own two feet
          I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
          Every night away (every night), every day alone (every day)
          Get me back on my own two feet
          I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
          Oh-oh-oh-oh
          Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
          Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
          Gloria, will you just decide?
          Gloria, there's easier ways to die
          Gloria, have you had enough?</pre>
