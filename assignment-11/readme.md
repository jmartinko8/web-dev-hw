I really want to set up my site like the example you provided. It is clean, simple, seems really easy to navigate, and I think that would be perfect for what I want my final site to be. I'm wanting to make my final site for our University's club baseball team, of which I am the president of. I think adding a website to go along with our social media pages would only help our online presence. So I don't have an actual sketch, I guess you could say it would be similar to the example provided.

my work process was very patchy, I looked at how I could try to do this in a simple way, which found it to not be so simple. the video did help some, but the just straight up visual examples and allowing us to peep git hub for reference was nice to see if I was on the right track. I feel like I kind of am on the right track, but I still need a lot of help to be full steam ahead... wow, that was quite the train reference there. lol! anyway I do need help getting my banner picture to move over and not be covered by my sidebar.
