I learned so much from this class. I had no prior experience with web design before this and it was really fun. It was a lot more fun than I anticipated and actually enjoyed learning and playing around with atom.
My work cycle was pretty intense. my biggest problem was linking the sites together. I feel like the coding all turned out ok minus that one issue.
