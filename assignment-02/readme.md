11) A paragraph on why I joined this class

So I decided to join this class because I needed to take an upper level elective class. I'm a journalism major and am currently taking 3 upper level classes for my major. I asked one of my professors what his suggestion was for me to take as an elective and he suggested that I take this class because he thought this class would help me better understand technology and how to create a website. He thought that would be a good tool to have on top of learning how to be a sports journalist.

12) a list of 3 things I have learned or hope to learned

-I hope to understand how the internet works more than just typing a URL and magically going to a website
-I also want to learn how to create a site where I can show projects I would eventually be doing in my journalism field
-lastly I hope to gain better knowledge about computers in general, journalism is almost impossible in this day and age without them, so the more I know about them, the more efficient I can be at my work in the future
