    <p>
        I chose to make this highlighting bunting because it was a big part of my life as a ball player.
      When i was ten, I was the smallest kid on my team and my coach said the only way I was going to
      get on base, was by either walking, or learning how to bunt for hits since I was also pretty fast.
      I did this because I think it is a part of baseball that is dying and I still think it has a
      valuable place in the game of baseball. you can learn more about bunting by probably googling it.</p>
