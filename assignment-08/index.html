      <h1>How to Bunt a Baseball</h1>
      <h2>directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Baseball Bat</li>
        <li>1 baseball</li>
        <li>1 friend to throw you the ball</li>

      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>take the bat and get into a batting stance
            based off of your dominant hand (ex. right handed)</li>
        <li>have your friend stand about 20-25 feet from you</li>
        <li>turn your shoulders and bend your knees</li>
        <li>present the bat out in front of your body,
            at about a 70-degree angle</li>
        <li>as your friend throws the ball to you,
            move your body up or down to adjust your
            bat to where the ball is pitched</li>
        <li>let the ball hit your bat,
            (dont stab at the ball with your bat as it comes toward you,
            use your bat to deaden the ball)</li>
        <li>if your partner throws it too high or too low,
            pull your bat back towards your shoulder,
            and try again</li>
        <li>as you practice it,
            try angling your bat towards the first and third base lines.
            directional bunting is very important in trying to master this skill.</li>
      </ol>
