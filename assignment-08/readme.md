HTML was very interesting. a lot of different parts go into it, a hell of a lot more than I realized, But I had a lot of fun playing with it and going through all the steps and slowly building a HTML site.
Im excited to learn how to style a HTML site more. the more tricks and cool style stuff the more interested I am. these last couple of assignments have been kinda confusing but also really fun to work on.
my work cycle hasnt really changed. again its mostly following along with the walk through video but this week i took some things from past assignments and had to incorperate them into this one.
